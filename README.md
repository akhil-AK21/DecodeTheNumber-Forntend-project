# DecodeTheNumber-Forntend-project

##Description:-

This project is a static webpage game designed to decode a 4 digit random number.The user can decode the correct number based on the clues displyed at the right side panel for each tries. This was build by the inspiration of a game that I have played a few years ago named "MASTERMIND".

#Technologies use:-
1. HTML5
2. CSS custom properties
3. JavaScript

#What I have leanerd--
Hands-on experince is always necessary for grasping the knowledge fully. Through this project I have learned a lot of things where I was weak and strong etc.It helped my skills to improve a lot.

The console is the best way to deal the webpages, its really fun to try new things.The main hurdle for me was the animation of shaking the digit holder fields. Thought it has'nt been solved fully, I am satisfied by my work so far.There's a lot to learn ahead and I'm looking forward to face many challenges that gonna sharpen me.

#Resource:-
Many concepts have been cleared by sites like W3schools.com,stackoverflow, csstricks etc...
